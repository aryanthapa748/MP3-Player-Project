# MP3-Player-Project
In this project, i created a basic MP3 player using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project covers fundamental concepts, including handling audio playback and managing a playlist. I implemented functionalities such as play, pause, next, previous, and shuffle, as well as dynamically update the user interface based on the current song.
